### How to get the Disco Planet Project

The Disco Planet Project is hosted at GitHub as a GIT repository.
[GIT](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed versioning control system.

You can clone this project with GitHubDesktop or with the following command in console:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/B3N5CH1/DiscoPlanet.git
```

Then you should be able to open the project directly in Unity3D. Make sure you select the DiscoPlanet folder.

If you want to directly play the game, launch the DiscoPlanet.exe in the _Win_Build_Version folder.
